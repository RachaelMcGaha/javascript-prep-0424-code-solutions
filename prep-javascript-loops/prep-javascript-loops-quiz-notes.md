## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  The purpose of the condition expression is to define the parameters to either continue or stop iterating.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  The first or initialization expression is evaluated at the beginning. It defines an index variable to start iterating through. This is only done once during each function invocation.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The second or condition expression is evaluated after the initialization. After the final expression is checked, it skips the initialization, and goes back to check the condition or second expression.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  After the condition expression is met, the third or final expression is evaluated. If the condition is not met, the final expression will stop.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  The purpose of the final expression is to loop through arrays and strings using a counter to increment or decrement.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  The data type that 'for...in' loops are used on is properties of an object.
